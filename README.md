# Homework_parser

This is a hometask, aim is to write a simple parser for a markdown document.
So far I have a strong, italic, h1 and h#, where # is a digit, starting from 2, tag.
Almost done with a list concept, just need to add an opening and closing tags for both list types.
The elements of the lists are being parsed succesfully. Of course, the really strict requairment in 
this code's case is that the input text must follow certain rules. I will inlist 'em write after I'm done.
